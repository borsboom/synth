{"name":"Synth","tagline":"A Java-based software modular synthesizer","body":"<strong>Project status:</strong> abandoned.  Amazingly, it still mostly works and is kind of fun to play with, but there are really nice cheap/free modular synthesizers out there that do 1000x what this program does.\r\n<br><strong>Developed:</strong> 1996</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a Java-based software modular synthesizer.  It is is used to\r\n  generate sounds. You design the sound\r\nby putting together basic building blocks (generators): oscillators,\r\nenvelopes, adders, etc. Once the design is done, you instruct the\r\nprogram to generate the sound (which can take some time, depending on\r\nthe complexity of the sound).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I created this program for a University course I took in first year to explore audio synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This program is really old, but you can still <a href=\"http://downloads.borsboom.io/synth/zrs-synth-0.95/index.html\">try it out</a> as an applet.
