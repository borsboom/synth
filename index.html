        <p><strong>Project status:</strong> abandoned.  Amazingly, it still mostly works and is kind of fun to play with, but there are really nice cheap/free modular synthesizers out there that do 1000x what this program does.
<br><strong>Developed:</strong> 1996</p>

<p>This is a Java-based software modular synthesizer.  It is is used to
  generate sounds. You design the sound
by putting together basic building blocks (generators): oscillators,
envelopes, adders, etc. Once the design is done, you instruct the
program to generate the sound (which can take some time, depending on
the complexity of the sound).</p>

<p>I created this program for a University course I took in first year to explore audio synthesis.</p>

<p>This program is really old, but you can still <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/synth/zrs-synth-0.95/index.html">try it out</a> as an applet.  There's also a <a href="http://science.webhostinggeeks.com/zrssynth">Serbo-Croatian translation</a> available, done by Jovana Milutinovich</p>

<p>Download the application: <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/synth/zrs-synth-0.95.zip">zrs-synth-0.95.zip</a> or <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/borsboom-downloads/synth/zrs-synth-0.95.tar.gz%22">zrs-synth-0.95.tar.gz</a>
