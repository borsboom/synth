Use the above button to bring up a synthesizer window.
You may need to wait while it loads if you have a slow connection.
Note that, when running as an applet, you cannot save your work
(to do that, download the distribution at the bottom of this page
and run it locally).  You can, however load the examples (see the
end of the tutorial).  I'd recommend that you use MS Internet
Explorer 3.x as your browser; it is much faster than
Netscape.

This Java program can be used to generate sounds.
You design the sound by putting together basic building blocks
(<i>generators</i>): oscillators, envelopes, adders, etc.
Once the design is done, you instruct the program to generate the sound (which can take some time, depending on the complexity of the sound).

<h1 align=center>Short Tutorial</h1>
<p>
<img src="images/tut/OscillatorBox.gif" alt="" align=right>
The most important building block is the <i>oscillator</i>.
The oscillator generates a basic wave pattern, such as a sin wave, triangle
wave, square wave, sawtooth wave, or a custom wave which could be generated
by another program or sampled from the real world.
To create an oscillator, select <b>Oscillator</b> from the <b>Generators</b> menu.  
Then, click the mouse where you want to place it.
Once it is placed, the properties dialog box will automatically come up.
Here you can select the wave type (for now, leave it as sin) and then click Okay.
If you want to access the properties again later, double click on the oscillator.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/tut/Constant.gif" alt="" align=right>
An oscillator on its own isn't very useful;
you need some way to tell it how loud to be, and which frequency to play.
The three circles inside the oscillator, labeled `freq', `phase', and `amp',
are the <i>inputs</i> accepted by an oscillator.  You can feed the output
of another generator into each one of these inputs.
Lets give this oscillator a frequency of 110hz, and an amplitude of 1.0.
Select <b>Constant</b> from the <b>Generators</b> menu, and click where you
want it to be placed (a good place is just above and to the left of the oscillator).
As before, the properties dialog box will pop up, allowing you to select the
value of this constant.
Type in 110, and click Okay.
Now you have two generators, but you still need a way to hook the output of
the constant to the frequency input of the oscillator.
This is done by dragging from the center of the constant to the `freq' input
of the oscillator.  
Now crate another constant of value 1.0, and hook it to the `amp' input.
The phase input of the oscillator is optional.
You could also hook the output of a non-constant generator to any of these
inputs.
For example, it is very useful to connect the output of an envelope
generator to the amplitude input.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/tut/Output.gif" alt="" align=right>
Now we have designed a very simple sound: a 110hz pure tone.
All that's left is to have the program generate the waveform.
But first, we need to tell it which generator to use as the final output.
This is done by selecting <b>Output</b> from the <b>Generators</b> menu.
You place this as before, and hook the output of the Oscillator to its
only input.  Now, select <b>Synthesize</b> from the <b>File</b> menu (or
click <b>Synthesize</b> in the button bar).
Once this is complete, a new window appears which contains the waveform.
Click on the <b>Play</b> button to hear what it sounds like.

<h3><font color="#800000">Mouse Movements</font></h3>
<ul>
<h4>Selection</h4>
<p>
To select a generator, click on it.  All others will be unselected.</br>
To toggle selection of a generator, click it with the middle button
or ctrl-click it.  <br>
To unselect all generators, click on the canvas<br>
To select all generators bounded by a rectangle, drag on the canvas
</p>
<h4>Moving</h4>
<p>
To move a generator, drag in its border<br>
If you drag in the border of a selected generator, all selected generators
will be moved.<br>
You can move the entire contents of the window  (if all the generators don't
fit) by dragging with the right button (or holding down you Meta key if you
only have one button).
</p>
<h4>Connecting</h4>
<p>
You connect two generators by dragging from the center of the source
to an input of the destination.
</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>
Double click on a generator to bring up its properties, if any.

<ul>
<dl>
<dt>Constant
<dd>Outputs a constant value, no matter what time it is.
<dt>Oscillator
<dd>Outputs a basic wave pattern: sin, triangle, square, sawtooth,
or custom (which can be loaded from a .WAV file).
<dt>Adder

<dt>Multiplier
<dd>Multiplies the two inputs
<dt>Divider
<dd>Divides the first input by the second.
<dt>Envelope
<dd>This generates a simple linear time-varying envelope.
In the properties, you can draw the envelope, with time on the x-axis and
amplitude on the y-axis.
<dt>Delay
<dd>Delays its input by the amount of time specified by the input.
In the properties, you must specify the maximum amount of delay (default
one tenth of a second), because it must know how much to remember.  
It cannot see into the future.
<dt>Filter
<dd>Linear filter.  You enter the comma-separated coefficients for<br>
y(n) = b0*x(n) + b1*x(n-1) + ... + a0*y(n-1) + a1*y(n-2) + ...<br>
You need a working knowledge of digital filter theory (which I don't have,
so don't bother asking :-)) to use this.
<dt>Output
<dd>This is special.  Whatever you specify as the input, is what the
synthesizer will use for it's final output.

There are many known problems, most of which there isn't much I can do about.
There are lots of different implementations of the Java runtime, and they all
seem to have their own problems (mostly with the AWT windowing library).
Here are the platforms I've tried this on, and some observations about each one.
If anyone has suggestions or knows workarounds, please contact me.
<dl>
<dt>Solaris
<dd>Works great. I wish all the implementations were like this.
<dt>Win32 (Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0)
<dd>There are problems with screen updating, especially if you have Plus!
and have enabled "show window contents while dragging".  Scrollbars don't
work according the specifications, but I worked around that.  Dialog boxes
don't always come up the right size.  The mouse cursor doesn't change when
it's supposed to.  Screen updating is really slow.
(I do most of my development on this platform). 
<dt>FreeBSD 2.2-CURRENT
<dd>Serious problems with math.  Numbers disappear.  It core dumps when you
open a file using the Open dialog box.  It core dumps a lot, actually.  Maybe
it's the version I'm running.  (this is what I would be doing my development
on if it worked right).
<dt>AIX
<dd>Generally works okay.  There are a few strange things when it tries to
change the cursor.  Opening files doesn't always work.
<dt>Netscape 3.0.
<dd>Works well.  Often suffers the same problems as the platform it's running
on.  Usually some problems are gone, and new ones are there. 
<dt>MS Internet Explorer 3.0
<dd>Works very well.  Sound generation is really fast! (well, relatively
speaking)
</dl>
<p>
The sound output quality is really poor.  There's nothing I can do about it.
Java can only play 8khz &#181;-law audio.  If you want to hear the sound
properly, save the sound to a .WAV file and use another program to play it.
</p>

<p>
If you have any problems or notice any bugs (of which I'm sure there are
plenty), don't hesitate to contact me.  I'm also looking for as many
reports of how this works under different platforms, so please e-mail me
if you use a system not on the above list (especially if it's Linux or
MacOS).  Also talk to me if you want to add a new type of generator but
aren't sure how (or if you have created a new type of generator, I'd love
to see it).
